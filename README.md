# datascience-sandbox
does not by any means include projects to be completed. as much as i love continually working on coding projects, sometimes i just need to be given room to learn and retain my skills without holding myself accountable for anything. 

i'll be taking random datasets off the internet, cleaning em, maybe trying to use some tools on them. educating myself and all that. i don't expect anything here to follow best practises by any means, i just want to get my feet wet again after they've been dry for about a month.
